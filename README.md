## M1 fixes
 * pull image only if it doesnt exist--> For this we used grep to search for the ubuntu focal image, if it doesnt exist, pull new image. else if it exist, dont pull image and create the virtual machine. check out changes in [Provision.js](/lib/provision.js)
* we changed build.yml from ansible format to specified format and performed M1 task.</br>
 	We have modified the code in such a way that there is no requirement of ansible installation and inventory file</br>
	we parsed the build.yml file using [builder.js](/lib/builder.js). we ssh into the vm and execute the cmnds from [build.yml](/lib/build.yml) </br>
	We parse the build.yml as json object and execute the cmnds inside the vm

```bash
pipeline init
```
```bash
pipeline build itrust-build build.yml
```
<a name = "m2_tag"></a>

## M2 Tasks
we use [screenshot.js](/mutation/screenshot.js) to capture the screenshot of the file at the given port.
<a name = "mutate_tag"></a>
## Mutate Operators
*   We have defined all types of mutation operators in [rewrite.js](/mutation/rewrite.js) based on requirements  to be performed on any given .js file(randomly selected from mutate.sh).
*   This javascript file will select a random mutation operator and performs the mutation on the selected .js file

<a name = "harness_tag"></a>

## Test harness

*   we perform the mutation  by executing [mutate.sh](/mutation/mutate.sh) and the  images are store in mutation/images/ folder.
*	we generate the orignal snapshots from the url defined in build.yml, we can add more number of urls in build.yml.
*	The [builder.js](/lib/builder.js) file will perform the jobs based on the provided job name by verifiying it in <<build.yml link>>.
* original images are stored inside [original](/mutation/Images/original/) folder
* mutated images are store inside [mutated](/mutation/Images/mutated/) folder
*   differences in images are stored in [difference](/mutation/Images/difference/) folder

 For mutation-coverage, the builder.js  will capture the details of mutation snapshot urls and  writes to snapshot.json file and will execute the lib/mutation/mutate.sh script

The mutate.sh will</br>
		
*   it will clone the [microservice](https://github.com/chrisparnin/checkbox.io-micro-preview) 

*   capture original snapshots from the urls retrieved from snapshot.json by using the index.js service and save to  [original](/mutation/Images/original/) and kill the service
*   Now for every iteration, it will execute [randomSelector.js](/mutation/randomSelector.js) and picks up a random js file from the given location and mutates the js file by performing a random mutation  by executing the rewrite.js

<a name = "diff_tag"></a>

## Snapshot oracle and differencing
snapshot differences are stored in [difference](/mutation/Images/difference/) 
*   we use imageMagick to find the difference between the original and mutated image and store them in differences folder.
if they have differences, we calculate pixel differences between the images and decide if the image is changed or not. Based on the output we categorise it as changed or not.
if there is an exception, the exception log will be stored in the difference folder

<a name = "mutatecoverage_tag"></a>

## mutation-coverage
[mutation-coverage](/mutation/mutationCoverage.txt)
For every mutation, the results are stored into [result.json](/mutation/result.json).
*  It stores the .js file which should be mutated and the mutation operator. Along with this, the result.JSON will also store the source line and the changes made and also it stores the result of the mutation on the snapshot. i.e., whether the snapshot has been changed, not changed or exception.
The final mutation coverage details are stored in [mutation-coverage](/mutation/mutationCoverage.txt)

```bash
pipeline build mutation-coverage build.yml
```

## Checkpoint and Milestone Report

### Challenges Faced:

Our Task Board can be found [here](https://github.ncsu.edu/CSC-DevOps-S22/DEVOPS-14/projects/1).

##### Errors
dpkg error</br>
unable to launch chromium browser--> add executablePath: '/usr/bin/chromium-browser' in screenshot.js  </br>
issues while setting mysql password </br>
parsing snapshot.json file </br>
*   Dpkg error->Sometimes we are facing dpkg lock error and  couldnâ€™t complete the process, we edited the script(function call for dpkg) to kill the existing dpkg process </br>
*   Mysql access denied -> we fixed this issue with the help of set deb conf utils in the set up part of build.yml
*   Mysql Error -> when we try to run the itrust-build , we faced access denied for user root, so we clean the build environment at the end of script by creating a new user and deleting the user at the end of the script.
