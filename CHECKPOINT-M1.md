For MAC - M1

Error -- Basicvm was not detected when init file was run
Fix -- changed the binary name from basicvm to vm in the init file

Error -- .env file missing
Fix -- Created .env file in the main repo

Error -- When the vm with a name is already existing, new vm is not created and process is stopped
Fix -- Introduced new lines to stop and delete the old vm with same name

Enhancement -- When the vm with the default name is not available, it is spitting vm no available in to the console
Fix -- Used 'pipe' to avoid pushing the default lines.

Code Optimization -- Implementing mac and windows versions code in provision file

json -- Parsed the required data and saved the details into a dictionary. Eventually this will be saved into the config.json file

Error -- There was a TimeZone difference error when trying to download or even update the apt package as shown below.

Fix -- Resolved this using the command:
vm exec pj 'sudo apt-get -o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false -o Acquire::Check-Date=false update'

But this error is repeating each time a new vm is created.

Error -- Process Captured Error happening when build is re executed. Not happening for a new vm. Yet to find the root cause for this issue.
