# Status
We have implemented the below details for both M1 process and Inel processor.</br>
 We have currenty finished the stage 1 of the project, but have to optimise and stucture the code based on requirements.</br>
 For the rest of the Project, we created build.yaml file and done with the setup part of the code, we currently parsed the set up part of build.yml file as json object and installing the tools/softwares like java , maven, mysql, wget and also cloned itrust into the virtual machine.</br>
We are fetching the name of the Virtual Machine from .env file(we can simply edit it and import it from .env file).</br>
We are storing the network configuration details like host, ip address, ssh info in config.JSON file.</br>

#Issues faced





# Work to be done
 we have parsed the build.yaml file as json object and executed as script file similar to CLI, we are planning to optimise the code using Ansible</br>
 We are planning to write opunit to verify whether the installation and version checks of all the softwares required for running itrust</br>
 We have to implement the build jobs using Ansible(currently working on this>).
 We have to configure .env file with appropriate details.

# Screenshots

Issues faced by windows users
.env file not detected and package json error
git issues for push and commit 
getting vm status
Arranging network data from bakerx to dictionary and exporting it to config.Json
And also for basicvm
//detecting os and call the specific createVM machine
when we assign vm name to a variable"name" , we are getting name clash with "js-yaml" to avoid we used vm_name, and trying to push it to env file


// status= trying to implement CM using ansible
For MAC - M1

Error -- Basicvm was not detected when init file was run
Fix -- changed the binary name from basicvm to vm in the init file

Error -- .env file missing
Fix -- Created .env file in the main repo

Error -- When the vm with a name is already existing, new vm is not created and process is stopped
Fix -- Introduced new lines to stop and delete the old vm with same name

Enhancement -- When the vm with the default name is not available, it is spitting vm no available in to the console
Fix -- Used 'pipe' to avoid pushing the default lines.

Code Optimization -- Implementing mac and windows versions code in provision file

json -- Parsed the required data and saved the details into a dictionary. Eventually this will be saved into the config.json file

Error -- There was a TimeZone difference error when trying to download or even update the apt package as shown below.

Fix -- Resolved this using the command:
vm exec pj 'sudo apt-get -o Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false -o Acquire::Check-Date=false update'

But this error is repeating each time a new vm is created.

Error -- Process Captured Error happening when build is re executed. Not happening for a new vm. Yet to find the root cause for this issue.

-- Successfully ran init and configuration is being saved into config.json and vm is created.

-- Able to run the set up and install the iTrust inside the vm. Jobs are need to be fully defined to finish the project.
